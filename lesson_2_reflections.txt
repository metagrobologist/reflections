What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A directory .git is created describing the current situation.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is a temporary holding place for the files you are working on/plan on changing.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Since you can selectively add those files that are relevant/belong to the logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

In teamwork where different people will add different features or variants of the project, while some will keep working on the main functionality (master)
Branches to use always working, experimental, squash bugs.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Makes the structure visual and perhaps more clear.
